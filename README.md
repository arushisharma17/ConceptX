### Using Poetry
Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. Poetry offers a lockfile to ensure repeatable installs, and can build your project for distribution.

1. Install Poetry if you haven’t already:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arushisharma17/ConceptX.git
   cd ConceptX
   poetry install
   ```

### Using pip

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arushisharma17/ConceptX.git
